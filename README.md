Background
--------
A pharmaceual company, Pymaceuticals, has begun screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

This company has completed its most recent animal study and needs to visualize the results. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

This repository is teh tables, figures, and visualizations as well as the analysis of them for technical report of the clinical study.

## Objective ##

Prepare the data:
* Merge the mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames into a single DataFrame
* Remove any duplicate data

Generate a summary statistics dataframe:
* Indeces for each drug regimen.
* A column for each of the following statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume.

Create bar charts and pie charts.

Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

Calculate correlation and regression.

Submit your final analysis.
